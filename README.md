## ✨ Features

### 🌐 Public Side

- **Dynamic Blog:** Read my latest technical insights and "First Commit" stories.

## 🔒 Security

Security is a top priority, especially given my background in IT operations:

- **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS):** Ensures that only the authorized Admin UUID can modify data.
- **Read-Only Access:** Public users are strictly limited to read-only permissions for published content.
- **Environment Safety:** All API keys and sensitive configurations are managed through Vercel environment variables.
